# odin-landing-page

HTML and CSS project from The Odin Project's Foundations course.

A design was provided as a .png file, available at ./img/desired-outcome.png. The goal is to replicate it as close as possible.
At this point, I haven't learned about responsive design yet, so I'm only targeting the desktop version.
